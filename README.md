### Questions for whomever
1. `font-awesome` is installed via `npm insall font-awesome -s`, best way to reference that from html?
2. Is there a better way to store authentication than just putting the token in the header? `shift-f5` blows the token away...
3. Is there a better way to verify authentication than just checking if a user exists?
